Hi raul, 
we here in the states are worried about your penis. if it starts to look like it will fall off. first we suggest ducktape! then go to a doctor quickly surgery is in order.


heatmap

Volume is stats from - column 40 to 175
when ending in "_R" this means right hemisphere side
when ending in "_L" this means left hemisphere side.
with no ending means irrelevant for side analysis. (discussed further down)
if you want you can organize by left and by right side or colorcode left in winter and right in summer in the same heatmap. that would be cool.

class - put as "Side" meaning left or right hearing loss
category - put as "Sex" meaning M or F.
Below if you have ability put "Scan Age" column 4 and "Audio Age" column 5.
if you can put this as colorbar with greater color older age and lesser color younger.
so you have 4 color bars on that axis.

For above we have the audiometric values  from column 6 through 39.

let me know if you have any questions. these csv formats are the newest. use them.



please send comments on our article and i will fix as soon as possible.
